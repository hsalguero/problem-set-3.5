      The defense is a core element of any football team. Without it, the team cannot prevent the offense from scoring points, as in any other sports. Like the <a href="1Offense.html">Offense</a>, the defense has linemen as well as other players including safeties, cornerbacks, and linebackers, all of which play essential roles in keeping the other team from scoring.

      Some of the things defenses aim to achieve are:
    </h4>
     <ul>
      <li>Fumbles - knocking the ball out of a player's hands while they are running with it</li>
      <li>Interceptions - catching a ball intended for a receiver to grant possession to your team</li>
      <li>Sacks - tackling the quarterback while they have the ball for a loss of yards</li>
      <li>Tackles - stopping a player in possession of the ball by knocking them to the ground</li>
    </ul>
