      The offensive players on a football team are in charge of getting the football from one side of the field to another.
      They consist of 11 players, as does the defense. There is always one quarterback, and a variation of linemen, running backs, receivers, and tight ends.
      Whenever the offense has the ball, they try to move it across the field either through passing or running the ball.
      Each instance where the football is moved is called a play, and plays are called from a playbook by the coach, who relays them to the quarterback, who then tells the rest of the offense what to do and where to go.
      After every play, a down is counted. The offense has 4 downs, or opportunities, to get a first down. Every 10 yards, a first down is achieved.
      If the team cannot convert within 4 downs, the other team gains possession of the football and has a chance to score. This is where the <a href="1Defense.html">Defense</a> comes in. If the offense manages to get the ball to the end zone, they score a touchdown.

      Each time a touchdown is scored, the scoring team is awarded 6 points, and have the opportunity to go for either 1 or 2 extra points. More often than not, a team will try for 1 point by kicking the football through the uprights, as in a field goal. If they want 2 points, they have to pass or run the ball from an area close to the end zone. If a touchdown is not scored, and the team is close enough to the uprights on 4th down, they may choose to bring the <a href="1Special Teams">special teams</a> unit out to kick a field goal for 3 points. Field goals are almost never attempted on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd down unless the game is about to end and they have no other choice.
