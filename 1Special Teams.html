    <h1>Special Teams</h1>
	<p>
  The special teams unit of a football team is unique because it is rare to find it in any other sport. Not many other professional sports have this kind of division of players on a team, unlike offenses and defenses. The only times that this unit is on the field are during kickoffs, field goals, and punt returns.

During a kickoff, either at the beginning of the game, the start of the second half, or at the start of each overtime period in the event of a tie game at the end of regulation. The team kicker will kick the ball across the field from the 35 yard line, at least in the NFL. The kickoff line varies in collegiate and high school play. The goal of the kicker and the rest of his team's special teams unit is to get the ball as far away from the end zone the team will have to defend, so the offense needs more yards to reach it.

      When the team decides to try for a field goal, the ball is snapped to the holder from the line of scrimmage, and the kicker then kicks the ball through the uprights for three points.

      In the event of a punt return on 4th down, the process is almost exactly the same as a kickoff with the same intention, except the ball is snapped to the punter and the punter kicks it from whichever yard line the play was started at.
